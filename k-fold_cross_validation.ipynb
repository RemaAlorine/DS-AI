    "\n",
    "- **Model Stability:** If your model is already stable and the dataset is representative, you might see similar accuracy scores across different splits. This means your model is consistent, but it doesn't necessarily improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Size:** If you have a smaller dataset, the test set in K-Fold Cross-Validation might contain more difficult samples, which could lower accuracy slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** If your model was overfitting on the initial train-test split, K-Fold Cross-Validation would reveal that by showing a lower average accuracy across the folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Focus On\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Check if the accuracy across different folds is consistent. Consistent accuracy indicates a stable model that generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** K-Fold Cross-Validation helps you understand if your model has high variance (performing well on some folds but poorly on others) or high bias (underperforming across all folds).\n"
