    "#### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "##### K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into distinct clusters. The goal of K-means is to partition a dataset into ùëò  clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It‚Äôs widely used in scenarios like customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection."
